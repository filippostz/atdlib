# atdlib

##### atdlib.py
Helper module for communicating with McAfee Advanced Threat Defense via REST API

The module exposes a part of McAfee ATD REST API through a single object atdsession.
It allows one to:
 - upload a file to the ATD box for analysis and get corresponding job id,
 - check job and task status for previously submitted samples,
 - get the analysis report for a given task in a given format.

Usage example is available in [EXAMPLE_PY](EXAMPLE_PY) file.

Proxy along with optional username/password can be specified through HTTP_PROXY/HTTPS_PROXY environment variable inherently to [requests library](http://docs.python-requests.org/).

Log level and format is controlled via atdlib logger, [logging module](https://docs.python.org/2/library/logging.html).

The module was written in Python 2.7 according to the [McAfee ATD API reference guide](https://kc.mcafee.com/resources/sites/MCAFEE/content/live/PRODUCT_DOCUMENTATION/26000/PD26048/en_US/ATD_3_4_8_API_Reference_Guide_revA_en_us.pdf).
Tested with ATD v.3.4.8.x (API v.1.5.0).

##### utests.py
Unit test set for the atdlib module. Requires proper initialization of test data (comments inside).

     |  
     |  open(self, host, user, pswd)
